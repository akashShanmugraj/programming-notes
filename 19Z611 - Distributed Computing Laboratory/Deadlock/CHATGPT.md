Absolutely! Let's walk through each of the four types of deadlock detection algorithms commonly found in distributed systems, breaking down their **intuition**, **pseudocode**, and how they differ from one another.

---

## 1. **Centralized Deadlock Detection**

### üí° Intuition:
A single coordinator gathers the *Wait-For Graphs (WFG)* from all nodes and checks for cycles. Simple but can become a bottleneck and a single point of failure.

### üìú Pseudocode:

```plaintext
At each site:
  On resource request:
    - Update local WFG
    - Send local WFG to central coordinator

Central Coordinator:
  Upon receiving WFG updates:
    - Merge all received WFGs into Global WFG
    - Run cycle detection algorithm (DFS or Tarjan‚Äôs)
    - If cycle found:
        Report deadlock and notify involved nodes
```

---

## 2. **Hierarchical Deadlock Detection**

### üí° Intuition:
Like centralized but with a *tree of coordinators*‚Äîeach handling a portion of the system and forwarding potential deadlocks up the hierarchy.

### üìú Pseudocode:

```plaintext
At Leaf Node:
  On resource request:
    - Update local WFG
    - Detect local cycle
    - If deadlock suspected, send info to parent coordinator

At Intermediate Coordinator:
  On receiving deadlock info:
    - Merge WFGs from children and own region
    - Check for cycles
    - If cycle found:
        Notify all involved
    - Else if deadlock suspected across regions:
        Forward to parent coordinator

At Root Coordinator:
  Do same as intermediate but final authority
```

> **Hierarchy reduces communication overhead** but might delay detection if the cycle spans multiple sub-trees.

---

## 3. **WFG-Based Distributed Deadlock Detection**

### üí° Intuition:
No central controller. Each site participates in *global deadlock detection* by periodically exchanging parts of its WFG and detecting cycles cooperatively.

### üìú Pseudocode:

```plaintext
At each node:
  On resource request:
    - Update local WFG

Periodically or on suspecting deadlock:
  - Send WFG edges to directly connected nodes (dependencies)
  - Receive WFG fragments from others
  - Merge and update local WFG
  - Run cycle detection
  - If cycle found:
      Declare deadlock and notify others
```

> Fully decentralized, but requires consistent and timely exchange of WFG fragments.

---

## 4. **Probe-Based (Chandy-Misra-Haas) Deadlock Detection**

### üí° Intuition:
Only initiated when a process waits. It sends a **probe message** to detect circular wait chains. If the probe comes back to the initiator ‚Üí deadlock.

### üìú Pseudocode:

```plaintext
Message Format: PROBE(initiator, sender, receiver)

At process P:
  On waiting for process Q:
    - Send PROBE(P, P, Q) to Q

At process Q on receiving PROBE(i, s, r):
  If Q is waiting for process R:
    - Send PROBE(i, Q, R) to R
  Else if Q is not waiting:
    - Discard probe
  If Q == i (initiator):
    - Deadlock detected
    - Inform initiator and involved processes
```

> Efficient and message-optimal, but only works for single-resource deadlocks or when wait-for relationships are clearly defined.
