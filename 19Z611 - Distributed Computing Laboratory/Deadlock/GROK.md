Let’s dive into the four types of deadlock detection algorithms in distributed systems: Centralized, Hierarchical, WFG-based Distributed, and Probe-based Distributed. I’ll provide intuition for each, followed by detailed pseudocode. These algorithms aim to detect deadlocks—situations where a set of processes form a cycle, each waiting for a resource that another holds. Distributed systems make this tricky due to the lack of a global state, so each approach tackles this differently.

### 1. Centralized Deadlock Detection
**Intuition**: Imagine one "boss" node that collects all the resource allocation and wait-for information from every node in the system. It builds a global Wait-For Graph (WFG) and checks for cycles. Simple, but it’s a single point of failure and can get bogged down with communication overhead.

**Pseudocode**:
```
// At each local node (Node i):
1. Maintain local WFG: G_i = (Processes, Edges) where edge P_j -> P_k means P_j waits for P_k
2. Periodically send G_i to the central coordinator

// At the central coordinator:
1. Initialize global WFG: G_global = empty
2. For each Node i:
    Receive G_i
    Merge G_i into G_global (union of vertices and edges)
3. Run cycle detection on G_global (e.g., DFS-based):
   - Start DFS from each process P
   - If a visited process is encountered again, a cycle (deadlock) exists
4. If cycle detected:
    Report deadlock with involved processes
5. Else:
    No deadlock
```

**Key Points**:
- Pros: Easy to implement cycle detection centrally.
- Cons: Bottleneck at coordinator, high message overhead, not fault-tolerant.

### 2. Hierarchical Deadlock Detection
**Intuition**: Instead of one boss, picture a tree of managers. Each node reports to a parent, which aggregates info up the hierarchy. The root does the final deadlock check. It’s less centralized but still structured, balancing load and fault tolerance.

**Pseudocode**:
```
// At each leaf node (Node i):
1. Maintain local WFG: G_i
2. Send G_i to parent node in the hierarchy

// At each intermediate node (Node j):
1. Initialize local aggregate WFG: G_j = empty
2. For each child node k:
    Receive G_k from child
    Merge G_k into G_j
3. If not root:
    Send G_j to parent
4. If root:
    Run cycle detection on G_j (DFS-based)
    If cycle found:
        Report deadlock
    Else:
        No deadlock

// Tree maintenance (assumed):
- If a node fails, reassign its children to another parent
```

**Key Points**:
- Pros: Distributes load, more resilient than centralized.
- Cons: Complex to maintain hierarchy, still relies on root.

### 3. WFG-based Distributed Deadlock Detection
**Intuition**: No central boss—every node collaborates to build and check the global WFG. Nodes exchange wait-for info directly, and one node (or all) runs a distributed cycle detection algorithm. It’s fully decentralized but requires more coordination.

**Pseudocode**:
```
// At each node (Node i):
1. Maintain local WFG: G_i
2. Broadcast G_i to all other nodes periodically
3. Maintain a global WFG view: G_global_i = union of all received G_k (k = 1 to N)
4. Run distributed cycle detection:
   - Use a distributed DFS or similar algorithm
   - Each node tracks visited processes in its local search
   - If Node i detects P_j (already visited) in its DFS path:
       Send "cycle suspected" message to all nodes
   - Confirm cycle by checking if all nodes agree on the cycle
5. If cycle confirmed:
    Report deadlock
6. Else:
    Continue monitoring
```

**Key Points**:
- Pros: Fully distributed, no single failure point.
- Cons: High message complexity (O(N²)), tricky to synchronize.

### 4. Probe-based Distributed Deadlock Detection (Chandy-Misra-Haas Algorithm)
**Intuition**: Think of a detective sending "probes" to follow the wait-for chain. If a probe comes back to its sender, there’s a cycle—deadlock! It’s lightweight and elegant, with each node only needing local info to start.

**Pseudocode**:
```
// Data structures at Node i:
// - waiting_for: Node/process that i is waiting for
// - probe: Tuple (initiator_id, sender_id, receiver_id)

// When Node i detects it’s waiting (initiates detection):
1. If Node i is waiting for Node j:
    Send probe (i, i, j) to Node j

// When Node k receives probe (init_id, sender_id, receiver_id):
1. If k is not waiting:
    Discard probe (no deadlock continuation)
2. Else if k has seen this probe (init_id already in history):
    If k == init_id:
        Deadlock detected! Report cycle.
    Else:
        Discard probe (not part of initiator’s cycle)
3. Else:
    Mark probe (init_id) as seen
    Let m = Node k is waiting for
    Send probe (init_id, k, m) to Node m

// Optimization:
- Only initiate probe if process suspects deadlock (e.g., wait time exceeds threshold)
```

**Key Points**:
- Pros: Low overhead (probes follow wait edges only), fully distributed.
- Cons: May detect false positives in rare cases (phantom deadlocks if state changes mid-probe).

### Where to Start?
1. **Centralized**: Easiest to implement first. Simulate a single coordinator and local nodes sending WFGs. Use a simple DFS for cycle detection.
2. **Probe-based**: Next, try this for its elegance. It’s intuitive (probes chasing the cycle) and practical for small systems.
3. **Hierarchical**: Build this after Centralized—it’s a natural extension with a tree structure.
4. **WFG-based Distributed**: Tackle last, as it’s the most complex due to distributed coordination.

For implementation, start with a simple simulation (e.g., in Python) with processes as objects, resources as locks, and nodes communicating via function calls or message queues. Test with small cycles (e.g., P1 → P2 → P1) to verify.
