Define a structure Edge with properties: weight, startNode, endNode

Define a list of Edge objects, edges

Sort edges in ascending order based on weight

Define a list, forest, to store the disjoint sets of nodes

for each node in the graph:
    create a set containing only this node
    add the set to forest

Define a list, MST, to store the edges of the minimum spanning tree

for each edge in edges:
    if the startNode and endNode of edge are in different sets in forest:
        add edge to MST
        union the sets containing startNode and endNode in forest

print MST
