For a Multistage Graph of N vertices, assume that we have edgeweight matrix of size N * N.
A cost matrix of size 1 * N has minimum cost of every node to sink
A nextnode matrix of size 1 * N has node from the next stage that gives the respective minimum cost
cost[n] = 0

FOR node = n - 1 TO 1 STEP -1
    mincost = edgeweight[node][0] + cost[0]
    minr = 0
    FOR ewindex = 0 TO LEN(edgeweight[node])
        IF edgeweight[node][ewindex] + cost[ewindex] < mincost:
            mincost = edgeweight[node][ewindex] + cost[ewindex]
            minr = ewindex
        
        cost[ewindex] = mincost
        nextnode[ewindex] = minr

path = [0, ]
pointer = 0

WHILE pointer <= 9:
    pointer = nextnode[pointer]
    path.append(pointer)
