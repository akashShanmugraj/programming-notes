# Source Code

### Importing Standard Libraries

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
```

We import standard libraries for input/output and dynamic memory allocation.

### Defining the Node Structure

```c
struct node {
    int data;
    struct node * left;
    struct node * right;
};
```

We define a node of our Binary Search Tree using `struct`, having integer (data) field and two pointers to the left and right child nodes.

### `getnode()` function

```c
struct node * getnode(int data){
    struct node * newnode = malloc(sizeof(struct node));
    newnode->data = data;
    newnode->left = NULL;
    newnode->right = NULL;

    return newnode;
}
```

A standard `getnode` function that takes in an integer and returns a pointer to a new tree node with the passed data

### Function to count total number of Unival Subtrees in a Binary Tree

```c
int countunival(struct node *root, int *counterpointer)
{
    if (root == NULL) {
        return 1;
    }

    int left = countunival(root->left, counterpointer);
    int right = countunival(root->right, counterpointer);

    if (left && right) {
        if (root->left && root->data != root->left->data) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (root->right && root->data != root->right->data) {
            return 0;
        }

        (*counterpointer)++;
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
This function counts the total number of Unival Subtrees in the passed Binary Tree and returns the count.

It's aim is achieved primarily by recursively traversing the tree in a bottom-up manner, i.e. inorder traversal. Then we check if the left and right subtrees are unival or not. If they are, we check if the current node's data is equal to the data of its left and right child nodes. If it is, we increment the counter and return 1. Else, we return 0.

### Standard Driver Code

```c
int main()
{
    struct node *rootnode = getnode(10);
    rootnode->left = getnode(10);
    rootnode->right = getnode(20);

    rootnode->left->left = getnode(9);
    rootnode->left->right = getnode(10);

    rootnode->right->right = getnode(20);
    rootnode->right->left = getnode(20);

    int univalcounter = 0;
    int *univalcounterpointer = &univalcounter;

    countunival(rootnode, univalcounterpointer);

    printf("Total number of UniVal Trees is %d\n", *(univalcounterpointer));
    return 0;
}
```

We artifically create a Binary Tree with 7 nodes, and then call the `countunival` function on the root node. We pass the address of the `univalcounter` variable to the function, so that the function can increment the counter variable as and when required.

# Real World Applications

I couldn't find any real-world applications of finding the number of unival binary trees. However, here are some real-world applications of binary trees:

1. **Binary Search Tree**: Used in many search applications where data is constantly entering/leaving, such as the map and set objects in many languages' libraries.

2. **Binary Space Partition**: Used in almost every 3D video game to determine what objects need to be rendered.

3. **Binary Tries**: Used in almost every high-bandwidth router for storing router-tables.

4. **Hash Trees**: Used in torrents and specialized image-signatures in which a hash needs to be verified, but the whole file is not available. Also used in blockchains for eg. Bitcoin.

5. **Heaps**: Used in implementing efficient priority-queues, which in turn are used for scheduling processes in many operating systems, Quality-of-Service in routers, and A* (path-finding algorithm used in AI applications, including robotics and video games). Also used in heap-sort.

6. **Huffman Coding Tree**: Used in compression algorithms, such as those used by the .jpeg and .mp3 file-formats.

7. **GGM Trees**: Used in cryptographic applications to generate a tree of pseudo-random numbers.

8. **Syntax Tree**: Constructed by compilers and (implicitly) calculators to parse expressions.

9. **Treap**: Randomized data structure used in wireless networking and memory allocation.

10. **T-tree**: Though most databases use some form of B-tree to store data on the drive, databases which keep all (most) their data in memory often use T-trees to do so.


# Challenges and Limitations

The code provided has a few limitations:

1. **Memory Management**: The code does not free the memory allocated for the nodes after their use. This can lead to memory leaks in larger programs or long-running programs.

2. **Error Handling**: The code does not handle errors. For example, if `malloc` fails to allocate memory, it returns `NULL`. This code does not check for that condition and would crash if `malloc` fails.

3. **Limited Input**: The tree is hardcoded in the program. In a more practical application, you would likely want to build the tree based on user input or data read from a file.

4. **Color Coding**: The color coding in the `printTree` function is not reset after printing a node with the target value. This means that all nodes after a node with the target value will also be printed in red, even if their value is not the target value.

5. **Color Coding Condition**: The `printTree` function takes a `ccode` parameter that is checked in an if-else statement, but both branches of the statement do the same thing. This seems unnecessary.

6. **Efficiency**: The code uses a recursive function to count the number of unival subtrees, which could lead to a stack overflow for very large trees. An iterative solution using a stack or queue data structure could avoid this problem.
