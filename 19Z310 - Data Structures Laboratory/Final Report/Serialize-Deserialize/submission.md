# Source Code

### Importing Standard Libraries

```python
from collections import deque
```

We will be using a double ended queue to traverse the tree in level order.

### Defining the Node Class

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
```

### Defining a Serialize Function

```python
def serialize(root):
    if not root:
        return "[]"

    queue = deque([root])

    result = []

    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        if node:
            result.append(str(node.val))
            queue.append(node.left)
            queue.append(node.right)
        else:
            result.append("-1")
    return "[" + ",".join(result) + "]"
```

The above code will serialize the tree in level order. The resulting string will be a list.
NULL nodes are represented by -1.

### Defining a Deserialize Function

```python
def deserialize(data):
    if data == "[]":
        return None

    nodes = [None if val == " " else TreeNode(int(val)) for val in data[1:-1].split(",")]

    kid = 1
    for node in nodes:
        if node:
            if kid < len(nodes):
                node.left = nodes[kid]
                kid += 1
            if kid < len(nodes):
                node.right = nodes[kid]
                kid += 1
    return nodes[0]
```

## Real World Applications

Used in Data Storage and Retrieval, used to store the state of a binary tree in a file or a database for later retrieval.

Used in Network Communication, to send data over a network in a format that can be used to reconstruct the original data structure. For example, POST API Requests / GRAPHQL API Requests. Serialization allows this to be done efficiently.

Undo/Redo functionality in applications: User actions are represented as a tree. State of Application is saved using serialization, thus enabling undo/redo functionality.

## Challenges / Limitations

Modify the serialize function to handle binary trees with values other than integers. Update the code to handle different data types and ensure proper serialization.

Implement a deserialize function that can reconstruct a binary tree from a serialized string representation. Test the function with different tree structures and verify the correctness of the deserialized tree.

## Conclusion

This question explores the serialization and deserialization of binary trees. 

The serialize function converts a binary tree into a string representation, while the deserialize function reconstructs the binary tree from the serialized string. 

These functions can be used in various real-world applications such as data storage and retrieval, network communication, and implementing undo/redo functionality in applications. 

By understanding and implementing these concepts, you can effectively store and transmit binary tree structures in a compact and efficient manner.
