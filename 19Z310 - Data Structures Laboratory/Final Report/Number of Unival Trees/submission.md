# Source Code

### Importing Standard Libraries

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
```

We import standard libraries for input/output and dynamic memory allocation.

### Defining the Node Structure

```c
struct node {
    int data;
    struct node * left;
    struct node * right;
};
```

We define a node of our Binary Search Tree using `struct`, having integer (data) field and two pointers to the left and right child nodes.

### `getnode()` function

```c
struct node * getnode(int data){
    struct node * newnode = malloc(sizeof(struct node));
    newnode->data = data;
    newnode->left = NULL;
    newnode->right = NULL;

    return newnode;
}
```

A standard `getnode` function that takes in an integer and returns a pointer to a new tree node with the passed data

### Function to count total number of Unival Subtrees in a Binary Tree

```c
int countunival(struct node *root, int *counterpointer)
{
    if (root == NULL) {
        return 1;
    }

    int left = countunival(root->left, counterpointer);
    int right = countunival(root->right, counterpointer);

    if (left && right) {
        if (root->left && root->data != root->left->data) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (root->right && root->data != root->right->data) {
            return 0;
        }

        (*counterpointer)++;
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
This function counts the total number of Unival Subtrees in the passed Binary Tree and returns the count.

It's aim is achieved primarily by recursively traversing the tree in a bottom-up manner, i.e. inorder traversal. Then we check if the left and right subtrees are unival or not. If they are, we check if the current node's data is equal to the data of its left and right child nodes. If it is, we increment the counter and return 1. Else, we return 0.

### Standard Driver Code

```c
int main()
{
    struct node *rootnode = getnode(10);
    rootnode->left = getnode(10);
    rootnode->right = getnode(20);

    rootnode->left->left = getnode(9);
    rootnode->left->right = getnode(10);

    rootnode->right->right = getnode(20);
    rootnode->right->left = getnode(20);

    int univalcounter = 0;
    int *univalcounterpointer = &univalcounter;

    countunival(rootnode, univalcounterpointer);

    printf("Total number of UniVal Trees is %d\n", *(univalcounterpointer));
    return 0;
}
```

We artifically create a Binary Tree with 7 nodes, and then call the `countunival` function on the root node. We pass the address of the `univalcounter` variable to the function, so that the function can increment the counter variable as and when required.

# Real World Applications

Here are some real-world applications of binary trees:

Used as Binary Search Trees, used in many search applications like map and set objects in many languages, Binary Space Partition, to divide the euclidean space into a hierarchy of regions, for Video Games, Binary Tries in high bandwidth routers, Heaps in implementing efficient priority-queues, which in turn are used for scheduling processes in many operating systems, Huffman Coding Tree in compression algorithms, such as those used by the .jpeg and .mp3 file-formats, Syntax Tree constructed by compilers and (implicitly) calculators to parse expressions, and many more.

# Challenges and Limitations

The code provided has a few limitations:

Lack of proper memory management, by not freeing up the memory allocated to the nodes after their use.
This can lead to memory leaks in larger programs or long-running programs.

Lack of Error Handling, by not checking for errors in the `malloc` function.

Lack of input flexibility, by hardcoding the tree in the program. Human Input is absent

Higher chance of Stack Overflow Error (for large trees), since number of Unival Subtrees are counted recursively. This can be avoided by using an iterative approach.


# Conclusion
The provided code is a C program that creates a binary tree, prints it, and counts the number of unival (universal value) subtrees. A unival tree is a tree where all nodes under it have the same value.

The code creates nodes using the getnode function and a tree is artifically constructed in the main function. The printTree function prints the tree in a visually understandable way. The countunival function counts the number of unival subtrees in the binary tree.

But some aspects such as memory management, error handling, and input flexibility are missing. The code also uses recursion, which could lead to a stack overflow for very large trees.
