## for Continuous Assessment 2
1. Definition of Function:
In C programming, a function is a block of code that performs a specific task. It is a modular and reusable unit of code that can be called from other parts of the program. A function typically has a name, a return type, a list of parameters, and a body. The function body contains the statements that define the behavior of the function.

Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function definition
int addNumbers(int a, int b) {
    int sum = a + b;
    return sum;
}

int main() {
    int num1 = 5, num2 = 10;
    int result = addNumbers(num1, num2); // Function call
    printf("Sum: %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}
```

2. Prototypes:
A function prototype is a declaration of the function that provides information about its name, return type, and parameters. It is usually placed at the beginning of the program before the main function. Prototypes allow the compiler to perform type checking and ensure that functions are used correctly.

Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function prototype
int addNumbers(int a, int b);

int main() {
    int num1 = 5, num2 = 10;
    int result = addNumbers(num1, num2); // Function call
    printf("Sum: %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}

// Function definition
int addNumbers(int a, int b) {
    int sum = a + b;
    return sum;
}
```

3. Storage Classes:
Storage classes in C define the scope, lifetime, and visibility of variables within a program. C provides four storage classes: auto, extern, static, and register.

Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

extern int globalVariable; // External variable declaration

int main() {
    auto int num1; // Automatic storage class
    register int num2; // Register storage class
    static int num3; // Static storage class
    printf("Global Variable: %d\n", globalVariable);
    return 0;
}
```

4. Scope Rules:
Scope refers to the region of a program where a variable is defined and can be accessed. In C, there are three levels of scope: global scope, function scope, and block scope. Global variables are accessible throughout the program, while local variables are limited to the block or function in which they are defined.

Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int globalVariable = 10; // Global variable

void function() {
    int localVariable = 20; // Local variable
    printf("Local Variable: %d\n", localVariable);
    printf("Global Variable: %d\n", globalVariable);
}

int main() {
    function();
    return 0;
}
```

5. Recursion:
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly. It allows solving complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, simpler versions of the same problem. Recursive functions have a base case that terminates the recursion and one or more recursive cases that call the function again with a smaller input.

Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number
int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0)
        return 1; // Base case
    else
        return n * factorial(n - 1); // Recursive case
}

int main() {
    int num = 5;
    int result = factorial(num);
    printf("Factorial: %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}
```

6. Command Line Argument:
Command line arguments are values

 passed to a program when it is executed from the command line. They provide a way to customize the behavior of the program without modifying its source code. In C, the main function can accept command line arguments using the argc and argv parameters.

Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    printf("Number of arguments: %d\n", argc);
    for (int i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
        printf("Argument %d: %s\n", i, argv[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

7. Pointer Declaration:
Pointers are variables that store memory addresses. They are used to manipulate data indirectly by referencing and dereferencing memory locations. Pointer declaration in C involves specifying the data type of the variable being pointed to.

Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num = 5;
    int* ptr; // Pointer declaration
    ptr = &num; // Assigning address of num to pointer
    printf("Value: %d\n", *ptr); // Dereferencing pointer
    return 0;
}
```

8. Operations on Pointer:
Pointers in C can be manipulated using various operations, such as assignment, arithmetic operations, and comparison operations. Arithmetic operations on pointers include addition, subtraction, and increment/decrement.

Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int* ptr = arr; // Assigning array address to pointer
    printf("Value at index 2: %d\n", *(ptr + 2)); // Pointer arithmetic
    ptr++; // Incrementing pointer
    printf("New value: %d\n", *ptr);
    return 0;
}
```

9. Passing Pointers to a Function:
In C, pointers can be passed as function arguments to allow functions to modify the original data. By passing a pointer, the function gains direct access to the memory location of the variable being passed.

Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

void changeValue(int* ptr) {
    *ptr = 20; // Modifying value using pointer
}

int main() {
    int num = 10;
    changeValue(&num); // Passing address of num
    printf("New value: %d\n", num);
    return 0;
}
```

10. Calling Function: Call by Value, Call by Address:
In C, function parameters can be passed by value or by address. Call by value makes a copy of the argument, while call by address passes the address of the argument. Call by value does not affect the original value, while call by address allows the function to modify the original value.

Example (Call by Value):
```c
#include <stdio.h>

void changeValue(int num) {
    num = 20; // Modifying the copy of num
}

int main() {
    int num = 10;
    changeValue(num); // Passing value
    printf("Original value: %d\n", num);
    return 0;
}
```

Example (Call by Address):
```c
#include <stdio.h>

void changeValue(int* ptr) {
    *ptr = 20; // Modifying value using pointer
}

int main() {
    int num = 10;
    changeValue(&num); // Passing address of num
    printf("New value: %d\n", num);
    return 0;
}
```

11. Return Statement:
The return statement in a function is used to terminate the function execution and return a value to the caller. It can be used to pass back a

 result or indicate the success/failure of the function.

Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int addNumbers(int a, int b) {
    int sum = a + b;
    return sum; // Returning the sum
}

int main() {
    int num1 = 5, num2 = 10;
    int result = addNumbers(num1, num2); // Function call
    printf("Sum: %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}
```

12. Passing Arrays to Function:
Arrays in C are passed to functions by specifying the array name without brackets. The size of the array is not required in the function declaration, as arrays decay into pointers when passed to functions.

Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

void printArray(int arr[], int size) {
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int size = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    printArray(arr, size);
    return 0;
}
```

13. Pointers and One-Dimensional Array:
Pointers and arrays in C have a close relationship. An array name acts as a constant pointer to the first element of the array. Pointer arithmetic can be used to access and manipulate array elements.

Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int* ptr = arr; // Assigning array address to pointer
    printf("Value at index 2: %d\n", *(ptr + 2)); // Pointer arithmetic
    return 0;
}
```

14. Pointers and Two-Dimensional Array:
A two-dimensional array in C is an array of arrays. Pointers can be used to access and manipulate the elements of a two-dimensional array. The pointer to a two-dimensional array points to the first element of the first row.

Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int arr[][3] = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};
    int* ptr = &arr[0][0]; // Pointer to first element
    printf("Value at row 2, column 1: %d\n", *(ptr + 4)); // Pointer arithmetic
    return 0;
}
```

15. Array of Pointers:
In C, an array of pointers is an array that stores multiple pointers. Each element of the array can point to a different memory location, allowing flexibility in storing and accessing data.

Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num1 = 10, num2 = 20, num3 = 30;
    int* arr[] = {&num1, &num2, &num3}; // Array of pointers
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        printf("Value at index %d: %d\n", i, *(arr[i]));
    }
    return 0;
}
```

16. Dynamic Memory Allocation:
Dynamic memory allocation in C allows the program to request memory from the system at runtime. The standard library functions `malloc`, `calloc`, and `realloc` are used to allocate memory dynamically. The `free` function is used to release the allocated memory when it is no longer needed.

Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int

 size;
    printf("Enter the size: ");
    scanf("%d", &size);
    int* arr = (int*)malloc(size * sizeof(int)); // Dynamic memory allocation
    if (arr == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed\n");
        return 0;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        arr[i] = i + 1;
    }
    printf("Array elements: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }
    free(arr); // Freeing the allocated memory
    return 0;
}
```
